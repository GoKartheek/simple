The personal data relates to the data subjects listed in Schedule 1.<br \/> 1.3 The Data Processor may initiate processing of personal data on behalf of the Data Controller after the Agreement enters into force. The processing has the duration as specified in the instructions in Schedule 1 of the Agreement.<br \/> 1.4 The Agreement and the Main Agreement are interdependent and cannot be terminated separately. However, the Agreement may be replaced with another valid Data Processor Agreement without terminating the Main Agreement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Purpose<\/strong><br \/>1 The Data Processor must only process personal data for purposes which are necessary in order to provide an online recruiting platform and in doing so providing the services set out in the Main Agreement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Obligations of the Data Controller<\/strong><br \/>1 The Data Controller warrants that the personal data is processed for legitimate and objective purposes and that the Data Processor is not processing more personal data than required for fulfilling such purposes.<br \/> 3.2 The Data Controller is responsible for ensuring that a valid legal basis for processing exists at the time of transferring the personal data to the Data Processor. Upon the Data Processor's request, the Data Controller undertakes, in writing, to account for and\/or provide documentation of the basis for processing.<br \/> 3.3 In addition, the Data Controller warrants that the data subjects to which the personal data pertains have been provided with sufficient information on the processing of their personal data.<br \/> 3.4 Any instructions regarding the processing of personal data carried out under this Agreement must primarily be submitted to the Data Processor. In case the Data Controller instructs a sub-data processor, appointed in accordance with clause 5.1 directly, the Data Controller must immediately inform the Data Processor hereof.

If requested by the Data Controller, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in answering any such requests and\/or objections.<br \/> 4.7 If the Data Processor processes personal data in another member state, the Data Processor must comply with legislation concerning security measures in that member state.<br \/> 4.8 The Data Processor must notify the Data Controller where there is an interruption in operation, a suspicion that data protection rules have been breached or other irregularities in connection with the processing of the personal data occur. The Data Processor's deadline for notifying the Data Controller of a security breach is 24 hours from the moment the Data Processor becomes aware of a security breach. If requested by the Data Controller, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in relation to clarifying the scope of the security breach, including preparation of any notification to the Danish Data Protection Agency and\/or data subjects.<br \/> 4.9 The Data Processor must make available to the Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Agreement. In this connection the Data Processor allows for and contributes to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Data Controller or another auditor mandated by the Data Controller.<br \/> 4.10 In addition to the above, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in ensuring compliance with the Data Controller's obligations under article 32-36 of the General Data Protection Regulation. This assistance will take into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the Data Processor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transfer of data to sub-data processors or third parties<\/strong><br \/>1 The Data Processor must comply with the conditions laid down in article 28, paragraph 2 and 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation to engage another data processor (sub-data processor).<br \/> This implies that the Data Processor does not engage another data processor (sub-data processor) to performance of the Agreement without prior specific or general written approval from the Data Controller.<br \/> 5.2 The Data Controller hereby grants the Data Processor a general power of attorney to enter into agreements with sub-data processors. The Data Processor must notify the Data Controller of any changes concerning the addition or replacements of sub-data processors. The Data Controller can make reasonable and relevant objections against such changes. If the Data Processor continues to wish to use a sub-data processor that the Data Controller has objected to, the Parties have the right to terminate the Agreement and, if applicable, the Main Agreement with a shorter notice, cf. 7.2. During this period the Data Controller must not require that the Data Processor do not use the sub-data processor in question.<br \/> 5.3 When the Data Controller has approved that the Data Processor can use a sub-data processor the Data Processor must impose the same obligations on the sub-data processor as set out in the Agreement. This is executed through a contract or another legal act under EU law or the law of a Member State. It must be ensured, i.e., that sufficient guarantees are provided from the sub-data processor to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (\"back-to-back\" terms).<br \/> 5.4 If the sub-data processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, the Data Processor remains fully liable to the Data Controller for the performance of the sub-data processor's obligations.<br \/> 5.5 Disclosure, transfer and internal use of the Data Controller's personal data to third countries or international organisations may only take place in accordance with documented instructions from the Data Controller - unless stipulated by EU law or the law of a Member State to which the Data Processor is subject. If so, the Data Processor must notify the Data Controller of this legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits such notification for important grounds of public interests.<br \/> 5.6 If the personal data stipulated in clause 1.2 is transferred to foreign sub-data processors, it must, in the said data processor agreement, be stated that the data protection legislation applicable in the Data Controller's country applies to foreign sub-data processors. Furthermore, if the receiving sub-data processor is established within the EU, it must be stated in the said data processor agreement that the receiving EU country's specific statutory requirements regarding data processors, e.g. concerning demands for notification to national authorities must be complied with.<br \/> 5.7 The Data Processor must, on behalf of the Data Controller, enter into written data processor agreements with sub-data processors within the EU\/EEA. As for sub-data processors outside the EU\/EEA, the Data Processor must enter into standard agreements in accordance with Commission Decision 2010\/87\/EU of 5 February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries (\"Standard contracts\").<br \/> 5.8 The Data Controller hereby grants the Data Processor a general power of attorney to enter into standard contracts with sub-data processors outside the EU\/EEA on behalf of the Data Controller, provided that the Data Controller has given prior written instructions in accordance with clause 5.1 - 5.2.<br \/> 5.9 At the time of the signature of this Agreement, the Data Processor engages the sub-data processors listed in Schedule 2.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Precedence<\/strong><br \/>1 Unless otherwise expressively stated in this Agreement, the Main Agreement applies to the contractual relationship between the Parties.

Upon the Data Processor's request, the Data Controller undertakes, in writing, to account for and\/or provide documentation of the basis for processing.<br \/> 3.3 In addition, the Data Controller warrants that the data subjects to which the personal data pertains have been provided with sufficient information on the processing of their personal data.<br \/> 3.4 Any instructions regarding the processing of personal data carried out under this Agreement must primarily be submitted to the Data Processor. In case the Data Controller instructs a sub-data processor, appointed in accordance with clause 5.1 directly, the Data Controller must immediately inform the Data Processor hereof.

However, this does not apply if this legislation prohibits such information on important grounds of public interests.<br \/> The Data Processor must immediately inform the Data Controller if, in the Data Processor's opinion, an instruction infringes the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the data protection provisions of a Member State.<br \/> 4.2 The Data Processor must take all necessary technical and organisational security measures, including any additional measures, required to ensure that the personal data specified in clause 1.2 is not accidentally or unlawfully destroyed, lost or impaired or brought to the knowledge of unauthorised third parties, abused or otherwise processed in a manner which is contrary to Danish data protection legislation in force at any time.<br \/> 4.3 The Data Processor must ensure that employees authorized to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.<br \/> 4.4 If so requested by the Data Controller, the Data Processor must state and\/or document that the Data Processor complies with the requirements of the applicable data protection legislation, including documentation regarding the data flows of the Data Processor as well as procedures\/policies for processing of personal data.<br \/> 4.5 Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Data Processor must, as far as possible, assist the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, for the fulfilment of the Data Controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights as laid down in chapter 3 in the General Data Protection Regulation.<br \/> 4.6 The Data Processor, or another data processor (sub-data processor) must send requests and objections from data subjects to the Data Controller, for the Data Controller's further processing thereof, unless the Data Processor is entitled to handle such request itself. If requested by the Data Controller, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in answering any such requests and\/or objections.<br \/> 4.7 If the Data Processor processes personal data in another member state, the Data Processor must comply with legislation concerning security measures in that member state.<br \/> 4.8 The Data Processor must notify the Data Controller where there is an interruption in operation, a suspicion that data protection rules have been breached or other irregularities in connection with the processing of the personal data occur. The Data Processor's deadline for notifying the Data Controller of a security breach is 24 hours from the moment the Data Processor becomes aware of a security breach. If requested by the Data Controller, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in relation to clarifying the scope of the security breach, including preparation of any notification to the Danish Data Protection Agency and\/or data subjects.<br \/> 4.9 The Data Processor must make available to the Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Agreement. In this connection the Data Processor allows for and contributes to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Data Controller or another auditor mandated by the Data Controller.<br \/> 4.10 In addition to the above, the Data Processor must assist the Data Controller in ensuring compliance with the Data Controller's obligations under article 32-36 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Data Processor must notify the Data Controller of any changes concerning the addition or replacements of sub-data processors. The Data Controller can make reasonable and relevant objections against such changes. If the Data Processor continues to wish to use a sub-data processor that the Data Controller has objected to, the Parties have the right to terminate the Agreement and, if applicable, the Main Agreement with a shorter notice, cf. 7.2. During this period the Data Controller must not require that the Data Processor do not use the sub-data processor in question.<br \/> 5.3 When the Data Controller has approved that the Data Processor can use a sub-data processor the Data Processor must impose the same obligations on the sub-data processor as set out in the Agreement. This is executed through a contract or another legal act under EU law or the law of a Member State. It must be ensured, i.e., that sufficient guarantees are provided from the sub-data processor to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (\"back-to-back\" terms).<br \/> 5.4 If the sub-data processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, the Data Processor remains fully liable to the Data Controller for the performance of the sub-data processor's obligations.<br \/> 5.5 Disclosure, transfer and internal use of the Data Controller's personal data to third countries or international organisations may only take place in accordance with documented instructions from the Data Controller - unless stipulated by EU law or the law of a Member State to which the Data Processor is subject.
